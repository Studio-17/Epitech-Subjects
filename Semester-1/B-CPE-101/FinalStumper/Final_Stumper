B1 - B-CPE-101 - UNIX & C LAB SEMINAR

   Final Stumper
       binary name: rush3
       language: C
       compilation: via Makefile, including re, clean and fclean rules

   /!\ WARNING /!\
           ·   Your  repository  must  contain the totality of your source files, but no useless files
               (binary, temp files, obj files,...).

           ·   All the bonus files (including a potential specific Makefile) should be in a  directory
               named bonus.

           ·   Error messages have to be written on the error output, and the program should then exit
               with the 84 error code (0 if there is no error).

       Only the team leader's delivery repository will be evaluated.

   INSTRUCTIONS
       You must develop a program that reads a character string (that represents  the  output  of  the
       first  rush)  and displays the assignment’s name and dimensions. If it doesn't match any of the
       assignments, you must display "none". Regardless of the response, you must  terminate  your  line
       with '\n'.

   /!\ WARNING /!\
       malloc, free, read and write are the only syscalls allowed.

   /!\ HINT /!\
       You may use your lib, but it must be rebuild when your project is.

   TEST MAIN
       Below  you  will  find a main function that you can either deliver as-is (beware to respect the
       current coding style!) or modify:

         #include <unistd.h>
         #include "rush3.h"
         int main()
         {
              char buff[BUFF_SIZE + 1];
              int offset = 0;
              int len ;
              while ((len = read(0 , buff + offset , BUFF_SIZE - offset)) > 0) {
                   offset = offset + len ;
              }
              buff[offset] = '\0';
              if (len < 0)
                   return (84) ;
              rush3(buff) ;
              return (0) ;
         }
